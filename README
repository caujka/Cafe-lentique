Cafe lentique is a tool set for making lenticular and bareer filter 3D and
animated images.

Currently available tools are:

interlacer.py
takes sequence of images and interleaves them.
Vertical strips.

cropper.py

calculates gradually increasing offset and cuts each image to match
the window.

Future plans:
* gui with minimal dependencies and max cross-platform coverage
* row-by-row processing
* multi threaded processing
* teapot-friendly installation
* 2D-3D convertor
* pitch test producer
